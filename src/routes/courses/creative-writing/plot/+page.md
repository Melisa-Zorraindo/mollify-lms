## Plot

Plot refers to the sequence of events that make up a story. It encompasses everything that happens in a story, from the beginning to the end, and includes the various conflicts, obstacles, and resolutions that the characters experience along the way. A well-developed plot should have a clear beginning, middle, and end, with a logical sequence of events that build toward a climax or resolution.

One useful way to think about plot is to break it down into its component parts. These may include the introduction of the characters\* and setting, the inciting incident that sets the story in motion, rising action that builds toward a crisis or turning point, the culmination or climax of the story's conflict, and the resolution or aftermath that brings the story to a close.

Understanding plot is essential for successful creative writing, as it provides the structure and backbone of a story. As a student of creative writing, it's important to study and analyze plot elements in other works, in order to gain a deeper understanding of how to create a compelling and engaging plot in your own writing.

## Tips and tricks

_The following are just guidelines, and there is no one "right" way to write a good plot._

1. Start with a central conflict: A good plot revolves around a central conflict or problem that the main character needs to solve or overcome.

2. Create rising action: Your story should gradually build in tension and stakes, leading up to a climax or turning point.

3. Add twists and surprises: A good plot has unexpected twists and surprises that keep the reader engaged and guessing.

4. Develop your characters: Your characters should be well-developed and feel real, with their own motivations, desires, and flaws that drive the story.

5. Show, don't tell: Instead of explaining everything to the reader, show what's happening through action, dialogue, and other sensory details.

6. Use pacing effectively: The pacing of your story should keep the reader engaged, with moments of tension and action interspersed with reflection and character development.

7. Conclude with a satisfying resolution: The end of your story should resolve the central conflict in a way that feels satisfying and true to the characters and the story.
