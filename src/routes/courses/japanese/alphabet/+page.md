# Japanese

## Alphabet

The Japanese writing system uses a combination of logographic kanji, which are adopted Chinese characters, and syllabic _kana_. Kana itself consists of a pair of syllabaries: hiragana, used primarily for native or naturalised Japanese words and grammatical elements; and katakana, used primarily for foreign words and names, loanwords, onomatopoeia, scientific names, and sometimes for emphasis. Almost all written Japanese sentences contain a mixture of kanji and kana. Because of this mixture of scripts, in addition to a large inventory of kanji characters, the Japanese writing system is considered to be one of the most complicated currently in use.

Several thousand kanji characters are in regular use, which mostly originate from traditional Chinese characters. Others made in Japan are referred to as “Japanese kanji”. Each character has an intrinsic meaning (or range of meanings), and most have more than one pronunciation, the choice of which depends on context. Japanese primary and secondary school students are required to learn 2,136 jōyō kanji as of 2010.

### Hiragana

Hiragana is a Japanese syllabic script that is used alongside katakana and kanji. It is a phonetic lettering system consisting of 48 base characters, each of which can represent a single mora or syllable. Hiragana is often used to write okurigana, which are kana suffixes that follow a kanji root to inflect verbs and adjectives, as well as various grammatical and function words including particles.

Furthermore, hiragana can also be used to write _furigana_, which is a reading aid that shows the pronunciation of kanji characters. Additionally, words that do have kanji renditions may sometimes be written in hiragana depending on the author's preference, to impart an informal feel. There are two main systems of ordering hiragana: the old-fashioned iroha ordering and the more prevalent gojūon ordering. Hiragana developed from man'yōgana, Chinese characters used for their pronunciations, a practice that started in the 5th century.

Hiragana consists of five singular vowels (あ a, い i, う u, え e, お o) and 42 consonant-vowel unions, including the particle へ, which is pronounced as "e" instead of "he". There are a few exceptions such as the three particles は pronounced "wa," へ pronounced "e" and を written and pronounced "o" instead of "wo". Hiragana can also be used to represent the velar nasal or fricative pronunciation of the g sound in the middle of words. Stroke order and direction for writing hiragana characters is standardized, and they were added to the Unicode Standard in October, 1991 with the release of version 1.

### Katakana

Certainly, Katakana is a Japanese script used alongside hiragana, kanji, and sometimes the Latin script. It consists of 48 base characters, each of which can represent a single sound syllable or _mora_, with several possible extensions, diacritics, and combinations. Katakana is derived from more complex Chinese characters or kanji, with each character created from components or fragments of these. The word "katakana" means "fragmentary kana" in Japanese.

Katakana is used for several purposes. It is commonly used to transcribe foreign-language words into Japanese, including loanwords or _gairaigo_, technical terms, scientific vocabulary, and onomatopoeia. Additionally, it is used for emphasis, the representation of plant, animal, and mineral names, and often for Japanese companies. However, unlike hiragana, katakana's syllabary usage is comparable to italics in English. One can compare the characters to Kanji, which contain multiple meanings and are used for verbs and nouns, while Hiragana is used for grammatical inflections, and Katakana is equivalent to italics.

The katakana script consists of 46 characters used in contemporary Japanese, as two have been replaced by vowels used as their pronunciations, and one is used for only one sound. Katakana has a 5x10 grid, where the five horizontal rows are the vowels (a, i, u, e, o), and the vertical columns represent the consonants they are combined with (k, s, t, n, h, m, y, r, w), including a final n consonant.

Katakana is also used to write Ainu, Okinawan and other languages. An extended digraph like yōon can represent imported phonemes not otherwise present in Japanese, such as "consistency" becoming "konshisutenshi". Aspiring learners of the Japanese language may use charts to visualize the 46 characters, their stroke order, and pronunciations.
