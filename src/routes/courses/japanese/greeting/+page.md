## Greeting

Japanese greetings can vary depending on the time of day and the formality of the situation. Also, the Japanese language has a high-context society, where greetings and the way people, in general, are addressed can vary widely. These are a few simple greetings you could use, especially if you are a beginner learner of Japanese:

- こんにちは！(Konnichiwa!) - Hello! (used during the day)

- こんばんは！(Konbanwa!) - Good evening!

- おはようございます！(Ohayou gozaimasu!) - Good morning!

- おはよう！(Ohayou!) - Good morning! (informal)

- さようなら！(Sayonara!) - Goodbye!

- おやすみなさい！(Oyasumi nasai!) - Good night!

- 初めまして！(Hajimemashite!) - Nice to meet you!

- ごきげんよう！(Gokigenyou!) - Hello! (used by host/hostess to greet guests)

- いただきます！(Itadakimasu!) - Said before eating or drinking, equivalent to "Bon appétit!" in French or "Enjoy!" in English.

- ごちそうさまでした！(Gochisousama deshita!) - Said after eating, equivalent to "Thanks for the meal!" in English.
