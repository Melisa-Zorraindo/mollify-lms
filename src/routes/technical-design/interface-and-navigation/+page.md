### Add your first software to your CV!

Throughout the first course in Technical Design, you will become familiar with technical drawing and Computer-Aided Design (CAD). In this lesson, you will receive a brief introduction to technical drawing and Norwegian standards. You will also be introduced to your very first CAD software: AutoCAD. At the end of the lesson, you will learn how to manage and organise AutoCAD files.

**Learning Outcomes**

On successful completion of this lesson, the learner will be able to:

- Understand what technical drawing is.
- Download and install AutoCAD.
- Understand what AutoCAD is used for.
- Create an organised file management system optimised for sharing and backup.

## Technical Drawing

Technical drawing is a discipline where drawings are made to visually communicate the design, functionality, and fabrication of products and constructions.

![TD-01-02-TechnicalDrawing02.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/5ae25c62-d01c-4974-a5d0-6d24499e2e92/TD-01-02-TechnicalDrawing02.png)

The development and production processes in creating new products and constructions require collaboration and teamwork. Technical drawings are the universal language for communicating the intended design. To ensure that the finished product consists of the intended design, the technical drawings must be unambiguous (not open for interpretation), regardless of whether the product is complex or straightforward.

Several types of technical drawings communicate different design aspects to different users. They are used by drafters, engineers, product designers, architects, contractors, carpenters, electricians, plumbers, mechanics, inventors, etc. Technical drawings are generally used for communication, production, documentation, and visualisation. To ensure drawings are clearly communicated, they follow established standards and norms that you will become deeply familiar with throughout this course.

## Standards

We find ourselves surrounded by standards in daily life, even though we might not be aware of them. “A standard is a common recipe for how something should be done or implemented. Standardisation is the process from need/idea to a fully developed standard.” (www.standard.no, n.d.) 

A basic example to consider is languages. Without a recipe for interpreting a language, we would not be able to communicate with each other. Standards in technical drawings serve one primary purpose: To ensure everybody reading the drawing interprets it similarly. Only when the drafter and the producer follow the same ‘recipe’ can the product be made according to the drafter’s specifications. Just as languages, different countries follow different standards. 

<!-- There was a table icon here -->
Below is a list of some of the standards used in technical drawings.

| Abbreviation | Organisation | Country |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ANSI | American National Standards Institute | USA |
| BSI | British Standards Institution | UK |
| ISO | International Organisation for Standardisation | Europe |
| DIN | Deutsches Institut für Normung | Germany |
| NS | Standards Norway* | Norway |

- The organisation is called Standards Norway, but the standards are called **Norwegian Standards** *(Norsk Standard)*.

For a more comprehensive list of the different standardisation organisations, read:

[International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Organization_for_Standardization)

Noroff is in Norway, so we follow the standards from Standards Norway in the programme. Mechanical and architectural industries are international, and companies operating across national borders must be familiar with some international standardisation organisations. Most importantly, many national standardisations comply with ISO, a global standardisation organisation.

![TD-01-03-CollaborationTechnicalDrawing.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/e7274af6-b123-4dc3-8b1b-7c61e942447d/TD-01-03-CollaborationTechnicalDrawing.png)

For example, Norway has standards named **NS-ISO**, indicating that the Norwegian standard complies with **ISO**. The recommended mechanical drawings book, ‘*Mechanical and Metal Trades Handbook’*, refers to **DIN-ISO** standards. This is because the book is of German origin and refers to German standards (*DIN*) that comply with **ISO**. The compulsory textbook, ‘*Byggetegning’*, refers to international and Norwegian standards.

To ensure the technical drawings you create comply with **NS**, the lessons related to creating technical drawings are based on information from the resources [Maskintegning](https://www.nb.no/nbsok/nb/a87b334e6516c57437015d6f0a484359?index=6#0) and [Byggetegning](https://www.nb.no/nbsok/nb/69b6e3af337bfe2a3c4cdf96825c8a8d?lang=no#0), which is part of Technical Design’s reading list.

In addition to Norwegian Standards, the Norwegian governmental construction and property company, Statsbygg, develops and maintains guidelines and manuals for construction drawings, CAD and BIM that are widely used in the Norwegian building industry.

## AutoCAD

As an introduction to the world of technical drawing, you will learn your first computer-aided design (CAD) software: AutoCAD!

![TD-01-04-AutoCAD.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/a830315e-f1ef-423a-9f63-ebbc559af7a7/TD-01-04-AutoCAD.png)

### AutoCAD in the industry

AutoCAD is a comprehensive software used for 2D drawings and 3D modelling, but it is mainly known for its 2D capabilities. It has long been regarded as **the industry standard for technical drawings in 2D.

With the introduction of 3D modelling, AutoCAD took a step back as the industry standard. Examples of modern 3D software used for building and construction modelling include Revit, ArchiCAD, Tekla, and DDS. Software like Inventor, SolidWorks, PTC Creo, and Catia are commonly used for product design.

Many companies currently use AutoCAD as secondary software in addition to dedicated 3D software. Due to its former status as the industry standard, you will most likely have to relate to it in some form regardless of the industry sector you choose to work in after graduating.

Within the architectural and mechanical industry, countless designs with AutoCAD require regular updates and re-design. This means that even though you might work in a company primarily focusing on other software, you will sometimes work or collaborate with people using AutoCAD.

This module provides knowledge of AutoCAD’s functionality and a foundational understanding of technical documents. You will also learn essential skills to produce your very own technical drawings in AutoCAD, preparing you for the next level: Modelling and documentation in dedicated 3D software. It is necessary to mention that this education strongly focuses on 3D modelling. However, getting comfortable with 2D before adding the third dimension is wise to ensure a proper understanding of the foundations.

**Activity**
Students who have not yet downloaded and installed AutoCAD are asked to do so now. Follow the instructions below to acquire AutoCAD:

**[Autodesk Student Programme](https://lms.noroff.no/mod/page/view.php?id=46413)**

## AutoCAD file management

You should already be familiar with personal file management, backup, and OneDrive. If not, we recommend you read up on it now.

<!-- There was a camera icon here -->
**Guided Activity** 
In the industry, offices will have an internal system for naming, sorting, storing, and backing up AutoCAD files. Watch the video demonstration below to view our recommended file management system, tailored to fit the Technical Drawing module.
